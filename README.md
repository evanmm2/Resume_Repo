This Git repository holds the code and data for projects done for classes in college.
Class descriptions:

CS225- Data abstractions: elementary data structures (lists, stacks, queues, and trees) and their implementation using an object-oriented programming language. 
Solutions to a variety of computational problems such as search on graphs and trees. Elementary analysis of algorithms. Class covers a variety of data structures using C and C++,
as well as basic ISAs.

ECE385- This course is designed to give students in computer and electrical engineering an ability to design, build, and debug digital systems that include programmable logic, 
microprocessors, memory systems, and peripherals. Class covers Combinational logic circuits, Storage Elements, Hazards and race conditions, Circuit characteristics (fanout, 
delays, etc.), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Combinational networks (adders, multiplexes, etc.) in SystemVerilog, Sequential networks (counters, shift registers, etc.) 
in SystemVerilog, Synchronous state machines, Static timing analysis, clock domains, metastability, synchronization, Logic simulation and testbenches, Microprocessors and 
system on chip, Project using a microprocessor and system on chip concepts. For the class, designed a fully function FPGA tetris that worked on a VGA monitor with partner.

ECE425- Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology and theory; CMOS circuit and logic design; layout rules and techniques; circuit characterization and 
performance estimation; CMOS subsystem design; Very-Large-Scale Integrated (VLSI) systems design methods; VLSI Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools; workstation-based custom 
VLSI chip design using concepts of cell hierarchy; final project involving specification, design, and evaluation of a VLSI chip or VLSI CAD program; written report and oral p
resentation on the final project. 

ECE391- Introduction to the concepts and abstractions central to the development of modern computing systems, with an emphasis on the systems software that controls interaction 
between devices and other hardware and application programs. Material includes input-output semantics, synchronization, interrupts, multitasking, virtualization of abstractions. 
Emphasis on learning to operate effectively in teams.

ECE411- Basic computer organization and design: integer and floating-point computer arithmetic; control unit design; pipelining; system interconnect; memory organization; 
I/O design; reliability and performance evaluation. Laboratory for computer design implementation, simulation, and layout.

Senior Design- Design and implement a project over the course of a semester with a team. Made a pressure based foot controller. Folder only has EAGLE files for circuit design.
