Official Description of course:  
Data abstractions: elementary data structures (lists, stacks, queues, and trees) and their implementation using an object-oriented programming language. Solutions to a variety    of computational problems such as search on graphs and trees. Elementary analysis of algorithms. Course Information: Prerequisite: CS 125 or ECE 220; One of CS 173, MATH 213,   MATH 347, MATH 412 or MATH 413. Class Schedule Information: Students must register for one lecture-discussion and one lecture section.
  
Topic List:  
C++ programming (compilation, classes, pointers, parameters, dynamic memory, memory management, inheritance, templates, generic programming)
Data structures - ADTS - (lists, stacks, queues, trees, dictionaries, priority queues, disjoint sets, graphs).
Data structures - implementation (linked memory, BST/AVL, B-tree, hash table, kd-tree, quad-tree, heap, union-find (up-trees), adjaceny list / arrays).
Algorithms (tree traversal, nearest neighbor, buildHeap, heapsort, BFS, DFS, MST, shortest paths)
