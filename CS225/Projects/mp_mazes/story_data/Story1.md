Tonight, the rainy skies are flooding the streets. Skyscrapers that stretch beyond sight pierce through the clouds to some indeterminate place
in the heavens. In the middle of the industrial district a man wearing a professional suit and carrying an umbrella is silently striding to what
looks like an abandoned factory. Ivy is growing up the crumbling walls, the windows are cracked or broken, and the sign of the company that
once owned the factory, Tesla, is threatening to fall any minute. Strange noises have been heard coming out of the complex in the middle of night,
and the professional looking man is there to investigate as part of the city safety committee. A believer in second amendment rights, he holds his gun
and wonders how he should enter: the front doors, a side window that is mostly broken, or what looks to be a crawlspace around back.

Judging the front doors to be the safest option, he carefully opens the front door.

Deciding that it would be best to take anyone squatting in the building by surprise, he jumps through the window with a loud *CRASH*.

# Story101

Thinking that if anyone dangerous was squatting in the building that entering from a crawlspace would be unexpected, he
slowly slips underneath the building.
