Unfortunately, the exact design has been lost like tears in the rain with the loss of access to university repositories.
All that is left is the PDF results of designing the am2901 and even those are without the lower level connections. 
There are also the results of running sims on it and ensuring that it passes design standards. The general design can be 
kind of seen, but I admit not having the actual files or lower level connection images is pretty bad.
The design itself was done in Cadence/Virtuoso and passed all design requirements.
