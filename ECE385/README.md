ECE 385 is the Digitial Systems Laboratory class. It had hands on projects for simple memory demonstrations on breadboads. 
The final project was up to our own choosing and done with a partner. We chose to make a fully functional VGA System Verilog Tetris.

Class Description:

Design, build, and test digital systems using transistor-transistor logic (TTL), SystemVerilog, and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). 
Topics include combinational and sequential logic, storage elements, input/output and display, timing analysis, design tradeoffs, synchronous 
and asynchronous design methods, datapath and controller, microprocessor design, software/hardware co-design, and system-on-a-chip.
